# Multivariate IR (Tevatron base)

This repository contains code to reproduce the experiments in [Multivariate Representation Learning for Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14522). 

The code is built upon Tevatron, a simple and efficient toolkit for training and running dense retrievers with deep language models.


Instructions to reproduce the set of experiments described in our paper are detailed in [REPRODUCE.md](REPRODUCE.md).
